# Red Field Manual

The purpose of this repository is to provide an easy reference to penetration testing resources and methodologies (in other words, a cheat sheet). This is a living document and will be updated until noted otherwise.

__Note__: Much of the information in the Checklists and Tools directories I obtained from a variety of websites. They will be acknowledged as they appear in this repo.

__NOTE 2__: I follow the work smarter not harder mantra, so if you believe I cheat somewhere in my methodology, that's unfortunate.

__DISCLAIMER__: The content in the repo is my own methodology. Please only use on targets you have permission to attack. I assume no responsibility for misuse or damage to systems.
