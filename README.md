# Red Field Manual

The purpose of this repository is to provide an easy reference to penetration testing resources and methodologies (in other words, a cheat sheet). This is a living document and will be updated until noted otherwise.

__NOTE__: I follow the work smarter not harder mantra, so if you believe I cheat somewhere in my methodology, that's unfortunate.

__DISCLAIMER__: The content in the repo is my own methodology. Please only use on targets you have permission to attack. I assume no responsibility for misuse or damage to systems.

## How to navigate
Within this repository, I will discuss two different ways to define your methodology:
* Cyber Kill Chain (Not started)
    * 7 Step specific process
* The Red Diamond (Draft Complete)
    * 4 Phase process
